## Git & GitHub Presentation + Live Demo | FALL 2017

### The README.md file is written in a language called Markdown. 
It is primarily used as a wiki page for your project. This will have all that is needed to understand what that specific repository is, who it is for, what is the intent of the repository, and more. You can add text, images, diagrams, and more into the README.md file.
